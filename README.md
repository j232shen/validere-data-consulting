## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains the analysis and recommendations developed for a take-home assignment as part of the **Validere Data Consultant** application process. The project focuses on:
- Understanding the behavior and needs of mom-and-pop investors
- Evaluating and comparing investment strategies suitable for financial advisors serving retail clients
- Simulating and optimizing portfolio performance through backtesting (maximizing profit and minimizing risk subject to client-specific constraints)
- Communicating insights to support advisor decision-making and client education

1. Clone the repo
2. Install required packages (e.g., tidyverse, xts, PerformanceAnalytics)
3. Run `preprocessing/eda.qmd` and `analysis/portfolio_sim.qmd` blocks sequentially, or render into `.html` files.
