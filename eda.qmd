## Load, preprocess, and clean data

```{r}
#| label: process-assets

source("ETL.R")

# fixed asset universe
# SPY: large cap equity (for comparison)
# VTI: all public U.S. stocks
# VXUS: most non-U.S. stocks
# BND: broad U.S. investment-grade bonds
# BNDX: broad non-U.S. bonds

start_date <- "2013-06-05" # inception date for BNDX
end_date <- "2025-06-30"

tickers <- list(VTI = "VTI", VXUS = "VXUS", BND = "BND", BNDX = "BNDX")
clean_returns <- get_all_log_returns(tickers, from = start_date, to = end_date) # xts object
```

## Visualize data

```{r}
#| label: plot-assets

# plot asset universe
plot.xts(clean_returns, multi.panel = TRUE, col = 1:4, main = "Log Returns for Fixed Asset Universe")
```

At this point, all necessary transformations were made (log returns) and the data has been cleaned via forward-filling, although the original date range did not have any missing values.
